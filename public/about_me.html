<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm studying web development, also python programming and Data Science. I'm a beginner in all 
  of those, but getting better every day.
</p>

<p>I'm also into music theory and music production. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I spent most of my life very unproductively, so now I'm trying to catch up
  on everything I'm interested about, some of which I hope can help me make a living.
